# Securiffy

 A Chrome extension that generates secure passwords at the click of a button and copies to the clipboard.

Settings are saved across devices, set once and generate on! Open the extension on any page to generate a password according to your settings. If you visit a page with password inputs, a notification badge will appear on the extension icon, and a button to copy the new password directly into the inputs will appear, turning them green to highlight that they've been prefilled by Securiffy. If you're lazy like I am, skip a step and check off the option to enter passwords into the input on the page as soon as they've been generated.
